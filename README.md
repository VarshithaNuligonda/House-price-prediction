# House-price-prediction
Predicting house prices are one of the important factors for the non-house holders, as they need to plan their budget. The system has been proposed with various algorithms and the algorithm that gives the most correct accurate level is considered. Houses are the central need for people and the prices of the houses vary from one place to another. House price prediction is a method that is used by any kind of people as no one can estimate the houses based on the location or the facilities in the area. The house prices detection is a very major and difficult task. The proposed model would make accurate predictions of the houses. In this study, we aim to leverage machine learning algorithms to predict house prices based on a comprehensive set of features. By analyzing historical data, we seek to identify patterns and relationships between different attributes and house prices. This research contributes to the existing literature by exploring the effectiveness of various regression algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, in predicting house prices.
